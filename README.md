#### Class 1 Reading:

1. I am searching for you for clients. I search for you for servers. So you both can speak to each other. Your language is like a passage. It is a foundation of data exchange. 
2. First, the HTML file is parsed, and then it will send a request back towards the server for the link connected to CSS or JS script. Then the browser will parse the link and script. After, the browser will create a DOM tree and implement the files into a visible depiction on the user's interface. 

3. You can locate images to access to a website by informing the HTML where the image stays, and the image can usually be seen in the directory. The layout you can use is images/your-image-filename. 
4. Strings are a form of data that can be depicted in a text form and written using single or double quotes. Quotes do not surround numbers; they are used to manipulate numbers. 
5. Variables are containers and their purpose is meant to store values. Variables are important in JavaScript because they hold a given value.

#### INTRODUCTION TO HTML:
1. An HTML attribute contains extra information about the given element that would not appear in the content. 
2. The Anatomy of an HTML element is described as an opening tag which is the name of an element wrapped in opening and closing brackets. Then content elements is paragraph text closing tag that uses forward slash before the name element.
3. The difference between article and section element tags is that article elements tags surrounds a block of correlated content that makes sense on its own without the remaining page. Section element tags focus more on the cluster of single parts of the page that represents one piece of functionality or theme. 
4. The Elements a “typical” website includes is the header, nag bar, main content, sidebar, and footer. 
5. Metadata increases you search Engine Optimization because its written in search engine language. 
6. Metadata describes data when the HTML adds metadata into document which is the meta element. 
  
#### MISSCELLANEOUS:
1. The first step to designing a Website needing project ideation which is when you ask yourself "what do you want to accomplish, how it will help reach your goals, what needs to be done, and what your goals are."
2. The most important question to answer when designing a Website is, "what exactly do I want to accomplish?"

#### SEMANTICS:
  
1. You should you use an h1 element over a span element to display a top-level heading because h1 represents the six levels of section headings. h1 elements give the text wraps around the role of the top-level heading on the page. <span> elements hold no semantic value. 
2. The benefit of using semantic tags in our HTML is that it helps the search engine determine the webpage's importance and content. 
  
#### JAVASCRIPT: 
1. Two things that require JavaScript in the Browser are the interaction with the users and the webserver.  
2. First of all, make a local copy of our example file, then save it in a directory somewhere sensible. Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web page containing a clickable button. Next, go to your text editor and add the following in your head — just before your closing </head> tag: You add JavaScript to an HTML document by using the <script> element.
